unified_mt5_processing:
  detection_logic:
    step1: Check column headers to identify data type
    step2: If <TICKVOL> present -> Candlestick data
    step3: If <FLAGS> present -> Tick data
    step4: Apply appropriate processing pipeline
  pipelines:
    tick_pipeline:
      1_filter: Remove rows where both BID and ASK are NaN
      2_spread: Calculate spread as ASK - BID
      3_midpoint: Calculate midpoint as (BID + ASK) / 2
      4_volume: Use <VOLUME> for trade size analysis
      5_flags: Decode FLAGS for data quality assessment
    candle_pipeline:
      1_validate: Ensure OHLC relationships (HIGH >= LOW, etc.)
      2_volume: Select appropriate volume column based on asset type
      3_spread: Use <SPREAD> for cost analysis
      4_features: Calculate additional features (body size, wicks, etc.)
  volume_mapping:
    tick_to_candle:
      tick_count: Count ticks in period -> <TICKVOL>
      volume_sum: Sum <VOLUME> in period -> <VOL>
    indicator_mapping:
      volume_based: Use <TICKVOL> for forex, <VOL> for others
      tick_analysis: Use tick data <VOLUME> for microstructure
