"""Simple semantic routing utilities.

The real project contains a service responsible for determining which
fallback agents should handle a request when the primary agent's
confidence score is insufficient.  For the purposes of the unit tests in
this kata the service provides a minimal stub with a single ``route``
method that may be monkeyâ€‘patched by tests.
