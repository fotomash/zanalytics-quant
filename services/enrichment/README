# Enrichment Service

This service enriches incoming market data before it is stored or published.
Processors are modular and enabled via YAML so you can compose custom pipelines.

## Running

Load the default configuration and consume ticks from Redis:

```bash
python -m services.enrichment.main --config config/enrichment_default.yaml
```

The legacy worker entrypoint remains for backward compatibility:

```bash
python -m worker
```

### Customizing modules

Toggle processors directly in the YAML.  Example:

```yaml
advanced:
  liquidity_engine: true
  context_analyzer: false
```

Adjust the flags and restart the service to apply changes.  Configuration
models and API hooks are documented in
[docs/enrichment_engine.md](../../docs/enrichment_engine.md).
