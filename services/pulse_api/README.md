# Pulse API

This service exposes core features of the Pulse runtime over HTTP. It wraps the
`PulseKernel` in a small FastAPI application so other components can interact
with scoring, risk management, and journaling capabilities.

## FastAPI shim

The API layer is intentionally minimal. It acts as a lightweight shim around
`PulseKernel`, allowing multiple services to share the same runtime while keeping
third-party dependencies to a minimum.

## Available endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `GET` | `/pulse/health` | Service health check and kernel status. |
| `POST` | `/pulse/score` | Score a market symbol for a given timeframe. |
| `POST` | `/pulse/risk` | Evaluate whether a trade signal is allowed. |
| `POST` | `/pulse/journal` | Append an entry to the journal. |
| `GET` | `/pulse/journal/recent` | Fetch recent journal entries from Redis. |
