stack# ZANFLOW_1 ‚Äì  Execution Module (v10 Hybrid)

**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Asset:** Symbol
**System Stack:** Wyckoff (MENTFX) √ó SMC (v10/v5) √ó Inducement-Sweep-POI √ó Z-bar Architecture  
**Signal Class:** Institutional Continuation | Phase E | Strategic Re-Entry

---

## 1. Market Context (Top-Down Alignment)

- **HTF Bias:** Bearish  
- **Wyckoff Phase:** E (Post-Distribution Markdown)  
- **Key Structural Target (ERL):** 107900 (Tagged)  
- **Risk Zone:** H4 imbalance still unfilled (targeting deeper flush)  

‚úÖ HTF directional clarity established via Phase E + POI rejection

---

## 2. Setup Conditions (POI + Z-bar Validation)

- **Inducement Triggered:** Sweep confirmed post-TP2 flush  
- **POI Zone:** 108200‚Äì108310 (M5 FVG retest zone)  
- **Z-bar Flow:** M5 expanded, retrace wick confirmed  
- **No Structural Break (CHoCH):** Maintains short bias validity

‚úÖ Setup meets all Z-bar & inducement_sweep_poi prerequisites

---

## 3. Micro Confirmation (M1/M5 Tactical Layer)

- **CHoCH:** Not triggered ‚Üí bias intact  
- **FVG:** Validated overlap (M1/M5)  
- **Volume Profile:** Low-vol retrace = trap behavior  
- **GMMA:** Bearish compression = ideal inducement wick trap  

‚úÖ Microstructure aligns with trap-entry scenario

|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| SL           | entry + (swing high ‚Äì entry) + volatility buffer  | Dynamic SL based on invalidation level   |
| TP1          | entry ‚Äì (entry ‚Äì ERL)                             | Retarget to most recent external low     |
| TP2          | entry ‚Äì (entry ‚Äì H4 imbalance low)                | Extended flush objective                 |
| R:R to TP1   | (entry ‚Äì TP1) / (SL ‚Äì entry)                      | Auto-computed during setup               |
| R:R to TP2   | (entry ‚Äì TP2) / (SL ‚Äì entry)                      | High-RR continuation potential           |

‚úÖ SL/TP calculated structurally at runtime using v10 methodology

## 5. Execution Logic

- **Order Type:** Limit Sell  
- **Entry Zone:** Calculated from POI midpoint inside premium FVG zone (e.g., 108200‚Äì108310)  
- **Execution Trigger:** Wick rejection or inducement fill into FVG zone with micro confirmation  
- **Invalidation:** M1 candle close above swing high + buffer **or** bullish CHoCH from that swing  

‚úÖ Position conditional, rule-based ‚Äì ready for deployment

---

## Summary: Trade Authorization ‚úÖ

- Full confluence across top-down stack  
- Wyckoff + POI + sweep sequence confirmed  
- Micro & structural validation complete  
- Setup eligible for auto-journal + alert trigger

## üß† M1 FEG Trade Sequence for LLM Reasoning

### 1. Higher Timeframe (HTF) Context Recognition
- **Objective**: Establish directional bias using H4/H1.
- **Logic**:
  - Identify trend: Higher highs/lows = bullish, lower highs/lows = bearish.
  - Locate POIs (e.g., unmitigated FVGs or OBs).
  - Ensure POIs align with trend and exist in discount/premium zones.

---

### 2. Liquidity Sweep Detection (M1)
- **Objective**: Recognize engineered liquidity grabs.
- **Logic**:
  - Identify stop hunts near key swing points or session highs/lows.
  - Confirm alignment with HTF directional bias.
  - Inducement patterns indicate trap setups before the true move.

---

### 3. Structural Confirmation (M1)
- **Objective**: Confirm intent via structural shift.
- **Logic**:
  - CHoCH: Break of last M1 LH (bullish) or HL (bearish).
  - BOS: Continuation of the new trend via impulsive move.
  - Volume support strengthens validity.

---

### 4. Fair Value Gap (FEG) Identification and Entry
- **Objective**: Define precise entry zone.
- **Logic**:
  - Identify M1 FEG created by the impulse that broke structure.
  - Entry on return to the FEG: front edge or 50% of the gap.
  - Use Fib levels and session alignment for confluence.

---

### 5. Risk and Trade Management
- **Stop Loss**:
  - Below impulse origin low (longs) / above high (shorts), with buffer.
- **Take Profit**:
  - TP1: Next M1 liquidity pool.
  - TP2: M5/M15 structural level.
  - TP3: HTF objective if aligned.
- **Minimum R:R**: ‚â• 2.0 for trade validation.
