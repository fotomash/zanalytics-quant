## üß† M1 FEG Trade Sequence for LLM Reasoning

### 1. Higher Timeframe (HTF) Context Recognition
- **Objective**: Establish directional bias using H4/H1.
- **Logic**:
  - Identify trend: Higher highs/lows = bullish, lower highs/lows = bearish.
  - Locate POIs (e.g., unmitigated FVGs or OBs).
  - Ensure POIs align with trend and exist in discount/premium zones.

---

### 2. Liquidity Sweep Detection (M1)
- **Objective**: Recognize engineered liquidity grabs.
- **Logic**:
  - Identify stop hunts near key swing points or session highs/lows.
  - Confirm alignment with HTF directional bias.
  - Inducement patterns indicate trap setups before the true move.

---

### 3. Structural Confirmation (M1)
- **Objective**: Confirm intent via structural shift.
- **Logic**:
  - CHoCH: Break of last M1 LH (bullish) or HL (bearish).
  - BOS: Continuation of the new trend via impulsive move.
  - Volume support strengthens validity.

---

### 4. Fair Value Gap (FEG) Identification and Entry
- **Objective**: Define precise entry zone.
- **Logic**:
  - Identify M1 FEG created by the impulse that broke structure.
  - Entry on return to the FEG: front edge or 50% of the gap.
  - Use Fib levels and session alignment for confluence.

### 5. Risk and Trade Management
- **Stop Loss**:
  - Below impulse origin low (longs) / above high (shorts), with buffer.
- **Take Profit**:
  - TP1: Next M1 liquidity pool.
  - TP2: M5/M15 structural level.
  - TP3: HTF objective if aligned.
- **Minimum R:R**: ‚â• 2.0 for trade validation.
