📘 ZSI Agent Strategy: Inducement–Sweep–POI Framework

🧱 ContextAnalyzer – Multi-Timeframe Structure and Trap Logic

Objective: Detect institutional intent via structure, liquidity and engineered patterns.

Logic:
	•	HTF Strong Highs/Lows: Formed after liquidity sweep + BoS.
	•	Weak Highs/Lows: Miss sweep or BoS → target zones.
	•	Define operative range: Strong High ↔ Strong Low.
	•	Segment Premium/Discount/EQ via 50% fib of range.

⸻

💧 LiquidityEngine – Inducement & Sweep Detection

Objective: Detect engineered trap patterns prior to POI reaction.

Logic:
	•	Inducement (IDM): Visual traps (e.g., OB, minor CHoCH) that bait retail.
	•	Sweep: Violent move clearing IDM → reversal begins.
	•	Must align with HTF directional bias and POI context.

⸻

🔀 StructureValidator – Swing Classification + Entry Confirmation

Objective: Validate Strong/Weak points and confirm LTF entries.

Logic:
	•	Strong High: Sweep + BoS down confirms protection.
	•	Strong Low: Sweep + BoS up confirms continuation.
	•	Weak levels → price magnets.
	•	Entry: After POI mitigation and LTF BoS or CHoCH.

⸻

🧠 FVGLocator – POI Typing & Refinement

Objective: Identify entry-grade POIs and their hierarchy.

Logic:
	•	OB: Last push candle before impulse.
	•	BB: Broken OB → flipped role post-failure.
	•	MB: Failed OB swing → later revisited.
	•	FVG: 3-bar inefficiency (BISI/SIBI logic).
	•	Rejection Wicks: Wick extremes post sweep.
	•	Entry: Limit at POI or LTF confirmation post-tap.

⸻

⚠️ RiskManager – Smart SL/TP Placement

Objective: Use logical invalidation + range objectives.

Logic:
	•	SL: Just beyond POI or liquidity sweep level.
	•	TP1: IRL – internal swing or FVG zone.
	•	TP2: ERL – sweep of Strong High or Low.
	•	Optional scale-out at EQ, fibs, or time-based targets.

⸻

📊 ConfluenceStacker – Timing, Volume, MTF Sync

Objective: Enhance setup validation with timing filters and bias sync.

Logic:
	•	M1/M5 alignment in M15/H1 bias.
	•	Kill Zones: Asia range sweep + London trap.
	•	Confirm AMD Cycle → Accumulation, Manipulation (Sweep), Distribution.
