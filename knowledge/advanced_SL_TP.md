Stop-Loss (SL) Calculation Agent FlowDerived from: M1 FVG Trading Logic (Reorganized & Refined) CanvasObjective: To systematically calculate the Stop-Loss (SL) price for a trade entered based on an M1 Fair Value Gap (FVG), ensuring the SL is structurally sound and aligns with the logic outlined in the reference Canvas.Agent Name Suggestion: SL_Placement_AgentTrigger for Agent Activation:A valid M1 FVG entry signal is confirmed.Trade execution is imminent or has just occurred.Inputs Required by the Agent:TradeDirection: (Enum: BULLISH / BEARISH) - The direction of the trade.M1_InitiatingSwingLow_Price: (Float) - The price of the M1 swing low that initiated the impulsive move which caused the M1 CHoCH/BoS and formed the FVG. (Required if TradeDirection is BULLISH).M1_InitiatingSwingHigh_Price: (Float) - The price of the M1 swing high that initiated the impulsive move which caused the M1 CHoCH/BoS and formed the FVG. (Required if TradeDirection is BEARISH).InstrumentType: (String, e.g., "Forex_Major", "Gold", "Forex_Minor") - To determine volatility characteristics.StandardPipsBuffer: (Float, e.g., 2.0) - A small, configurable buffer in pips to place the SL beyond the structural point for standard volatility instruments.VolatilityPipsAdjustment: (Float, e.g., 3.0) - An additional configurable buffer in pips for high volatility instruments (like Gold). This is added to the StandardPipsBuffer.PipValue_Instrument: (Float) - The price value of a single pip for the traded instrument (to convert pips buffer to price).Process Flow:Initialization & Input Validation:Agent receives all necessary inputs.Validate inputs:Ensure TradeDirection is either BULLISH or BEARISH.If BULLISH, ensure M1_InitiatingSwingLow_Price is provided and valid.If BEARISH, ensure M1_InitiatingSwingHigh_Price is provided and valid.If critical inputs are missing or invalid, log an error and halt SL calculation.Determine Structural Invalidation Point:IF TradeDirection is BULLISH:StructuralInvalidationPrice = M1_InitiatingSwingLow_Price.Rationale: This is the origin of the bullish impulse. If price breaks below this low, the M1 structure justifying the long entry is invalidated.ELSE IF TradeDirection is BEARISH:StructuralInvalidationPrice = M1_InitiatingSwingHigh_Price.Rationale: This is the origin of the bearish impulse. If price breaks above this high, the M1 structure justifying the short entry is invalidated.Calculate Total Pips Buffer:TotalBufferInPips = StandardPipsBuffer.IF InstrumentType is indicative of high volatility (e.g., "Gold", or a configurable list):TotalBufferInPips = TotalBufferInPips + VolatilityPipsAdjustment.Canvas Reference: "For volatile instruments like Gold, allow a slightly wider buffer..."Convert Pips Buffer to Price Value:BufferPriceValue = TotalBufferInPips * PipValue_Instrument.Calculate Final Stop-Loss Price:IF TradeDirection is BULLISH:Calculated_SL_Price = StructuralInvalidationPrice - BufferPriceValue.Placement Logic: SL is placed below the initiating swing low.ELSE IF TradeDirection is BEARISH:Calculated_SL_Price = StructuralInvalidationPrice + BufferPriceValue.Placement Logic: SL is placed above the initiating swing high.Canvas Reference: "Place the SL a few pips below the M1 swing low..." or "...a few pips above the M1 swing high..." and "...The SL should protect the swing point that created the FVG."Verification & Output:Ensure the Calculated_SL_Price is logical (e.g., for a bullish trade, SL is below entry price; for bearish, SL is above entry price. This check assumes entry price is also available to the agent or a broader trading execution system).Output the Calculated_SL_Price.Accompanying Rationale for SL (for logging or user information): "Stop-Loss is set based on the M1 structural swing point that initiated the impulsive move, CHoCH/BoS, and FVG. A breach of this level invalidates the immediate entry premise."Important Considerations for the Agent's Logic (from Canvas):Non-Arbitrary: The SL calculation is fundamentally based on market structure, not a fixed pip count unrelated to the setup.Avoid FVG Placement: The SL is not placed tightly within the M1 FVG itself, as this area can be easily wicked. The focus is on the swing point that created the impulse and FVG.Invalidation Principle: The core idea is that if the initiating M1 swing point is broken, the structural reason for the trade is no longer valid.This agent flow provides a structured, rule-based approach to SL calculation, directly reflecting the principles outlined in your M1 FVG Trading Logic Canvas.
