Ever looked at a trading chart and just felt lost? Yeah. Like you're trying to find some logic in all that noise. I think a lot of people feel that. Oh, absolutely. It can definitely look like chaos sometimes. Yeah. So today we're trying to cut through that. We're doing a deep dive into a really structured way to find hopefully high probability trading setups. Right. Think of it like we're designing an algorithm almost. We want to break down this specific trading strategy really methodically. almost like writing out pseudocode or drawing a UML diagram for it. Very logical, step by step. Exactly. Making it super clear, super logical. And we've pulled together some interesting material for this. We're looking at stuff from algorithmic trading flows, you know, how the machines think, and these detailed strategy playbooks, plus some core ideas from the classic Richard Wyckoff. Yeah, blending the old and the new. It's a good mix. It is. So the main focus is nailing these high probability entries. We'll use multi-time frame analysis for the big picture, understand liquidity, and then zoom right in on these M1 fair value gaps or FEGs for the precise entry. Sound good? Sounds perfect. Yeah. Let's get into it. The first piece, the foundation really, is that multi-time frame analysis, MTFA. Right. The big picture first. Exactly. This is about figuring out the why and the where. Why might price move? And where is it likely to go or react? So we don't just stare at the one minute chart. No, you go, Matt. You really would. We start higher up. Think, ah, four hour charts, maybe the one hour. H4, H1. Okay, so looking at the forest before the trees, what are we looking for there? We're basically trying to figure out the main trend, the bias. Are we seeing higher highs and higher lows? That's just, you know, a bullish trend. Right? Or are we seeing lower highs and lower lows? That points towards a bearish downward feeling in the market. That gives us our main direction to work with. So establish the overall flow first. Got it. Precisely. Then once we have that bias, say we're bullish on the H4, we look for specific zones on that same higher timeframe. We call them higher timeframe points of interest or HTF POIs. POIs. Okay. What qualifies as a POI? These are significant areas, often things like fair value gaps that haven't been filled yet on that higher timeframe maybe order blocks, basically places where price made a big move away from and hasn't really come back to test properly, key potential reaction zones. And these POIs, they have to match the trend we just identified. Yes, that's crucial. It's a key filter. If our higher timeframe bias is bullish, we're interested in POIs down in discount areas, relatively cheaper prices compared to the recent move up. Buying low in an uptrend, essentially. Kind of, yeah. And if the bias is bearish, we look for POIs up in premium zones, relatively expensive areas. It keeps us aligned with that larger flow. Okay, that makes sense. Don't fight the current. Exactly. And here's the rule, really. We don't even think about looking for our M1 FPG entry, that micro level signal, until price has actually reached and reacted to one of these valid HTF POIs that lines up with our bias. Right. So HTF context first, then price needs to arrive at that key HTF level. Only then do we start looking closer. Precisely. It's a top-down process, ensures we're playing in the high probability sandbox, so to speak. Okay, sandbox established. Price is now at our HTF POI. What's the next logical step in the framework? Now we zoom into the details a bit more and bring in liquidity concepts. This is about understanding the fuel for moves and spotting potential traps. Liquidity, always important. Crucial. So specifically, as price gets near or just enters that HTF POI we identified, We switch focus to the M1 chart, the one minute, and we look for something called a liquidity sweep. A sweep or a stop hunt, right? People call it that too. Exactly, a stop hunt. What it looks like is a quick, sharp spike in price past a recent M1 high or low. Poking through briefly. Yeah, just a quick jab. The idea is it's designed to trigger stop-loss orders that traders have placed just beyond those obvious M1 levels. It sort of scoops up that liquidity. Grabs the order sitting there. Why is that important for our strategy? Because fair value gaps, those M1 FEGs, were ultimately one of these liquidity sweeps. They tend to be much more reliable. The sweep has, in theory, cleared out the opposing orders. Ah, okay. So the path is clearer for price to move in the directions suggested by the HTFPOI because the sweep took out the immediate resistance or support in the form of stops. That's the logic, yes. It increases the probability that the FEG will hold and price will move from there. You mentioned inducement as well. How does that fit in? Is it related? It's definitely related. Inducement is price action that looks like it's starting a move, maybe a little pullback or break on the M1 before the real sweep happens. It tempts traders to jump in early. Only to get stopped out by the sweep that follows. Often, yes. It induces participation, creating more liquidity for the sweep to target. Spotting inducement can help you wait for the actual sweep and avoid getting caught. Okay, so wait for the potential sweep after price hits the HTF POI. What confirms the move after the sweep? Now we need confirmation on the M1 structure itself. So we've got the HTF POI interaction. We might have seen the M1 sweep. Now we need a clear signal that the M1 trend is actually shifting to align with our HTF bias. A final trigger, sort of. Exactly. And we look for two main things here, a change of character, or CHCH, and a break of structure, or BOAS. These are M1 signals. Great. CH-A-C-H and BO-S. Heard those terms a lot. Break them down for us. Okay. A change of character, the CH-O-C-H, is usually the first sign. It's an impulsive, strong move on the M1 that breaks the immediate M1 countertrend structure. So if price was pulling back down towards a bullish HTF POI, the CH-O-C-H would be a strong M1 move up that breaks the last M1 lower high. It suggests the M1 tide might be turning. The first real hint of a reversal on the small scale. Correct. Now, a break of structure, the BOCAS, is also an impulsive M1 move, but it happens when the M1 trend is already moving in the direction of our HTF bias. A BOCAS confirms continuation. So if we're bullish HTF and the M1 is already making higher highs and lows after the POI interaction, a BOCAS would be breaking the most recent M1 high. Reinforcing the current M1 move that's aligned with the HTF. Precisely. So CHCH suggests a change is starting. BOCAS confirms it's continuing. And both need to be strong moves, not just little wiggles. Absolutely critical. We need to see clear displacement, a strong momentum, a decisive move. That tells us there's real intent behind it on the M1 timeframe. Okay. HTFPOI, check. Liquidity sweep, ideally check. M1CHCH or BOCUS confirming the direction, check. Now, where does the M1 fair value gap actually come into play for the entry? Right. The specific M1 FEG we use for entry is the one that gets created by that impulsive M1 move, the CHOCH or the BOCUS that happened after the sweep and the HTF POI interaction. So the strong move leaves behind an FEG. Often, yes. That impulsive move creates an imbalance, a gap between candle wicks. That FEG is our target zone for entry because it was formed by the very move that confirmed our structural alignment across timeframes. It's a footprint of that confirmation. A footprint of the confirmation. I like that. How do we actually place the trade then? Enter right away. Usually not. We wait for price to retrace to pull back into that validated M1 FEG. We're looking for it to revisit that little zone of inefficiency. And where in the FEG do you enter? The edge, middle? That can vary. Some traders look for the edge. Some prefer the 50% level of the FEG. Sometimes other confluence might guide it. The key point is entering within that specific FEG created by the confirming M1 structure shift. Okay. Entry planned. Now, the really crucial part, WISC management, stop loss. How do we set that persuasively? Not just a random number of pips, right? Absolutely not. It's structurally defined. The stop loss goes just beyond the M1 swing point that created the FEG and the CHOS or BOTOS. Explain that a bit more. Okay. So if we're going long, bullish, the impulsive move up, the CH, CH or BORS, started from an M1 swing low. Our stop loss goes a few pips below that swing low. Below the low that launched the move. Exactly. If we're going short, bearish, the impulsive move down started from an M1 swing high. The stop loss goes a few pips above that swing high. That swing point is the structural invalidation level for this specific M1 setup. Ah, I see. If price goes back beyond that point, the whole reason for the entry, that specific M1 structural move, is broken. Precisely. The setup failed structurally. And it's usually smart to add a small buffer, you know, a few extra pips, especially on volatile pairs like gold, just to account for noise or spread. But don't put the stop inside the FEG or right at the swing point. Give it that structural breathing room. Protect the structure. Makes total sense. And take profit targets. We're aiming. Targets are usually set based on liquidity again. Look for the nearest M1 or maybe M5 swing highs or lows that haven't been taken out yet. Or look for other HTF objectives like the next opposing FEG or major swing point on a higher time frame. You want clear areas where price might be drawn. And think about risk-reward too, presumably. Definitely. You calculate the distance to your structurally placed stop, then look at potential targets. Are you getting at least, say, 1.2 risk-to-reward? Preferably more. If not, maybe the trade isn't worth taking, even if the setup looks okay. Some traders also take partial profits at the first logical target to lock something in. Right. Manage the trade as it develops. This whole process, it feels very logical, step by step, almost like coding, as you said earlier. That's exactly the goal, a clear, repeatable, logical sequence. And interestingly, even though we're using modern concepts like FEGs, the underlying logic connects back strongly to Richard Wyckoff's work from way back. Wyckoff, yeah, you mentioned him. How does this M1 FEG stuff connect to his ideas about accumulation, distribution, supply and demand? Well, Wyckoff was all about reading the market through price action and volume to see where supply and demand were out of balance. Our MTFA helps identify those larger potential accumulation or distribution zones he talked about. And those M1 liquidity sweeps we look for. You can think of them as potentially being modern versions of Whatcoff's springs or upthrusts. You know, those false moves below support or above resistance designed to shake traders out before the real move begins. Ah, the shakeouts. So they serve a purpose in his framework, too. A very clear purpose-testing supplier demand and trapping incorrectly positioned traders. Plus, Weckoff was adamant about trading with the dominant trend. Our whole emphasis on establishing the HTF bias first, that's pure Weckoff. He warned against just blindly buying dips or selling rips without understanding the larger context. Which is exactly what this framework tries to enforce. Context first, then the signal. Precisely. He also stressed studying individual assets, their character. While our framework is the blueprint, knowing the specific behavior of, say, UURSD versus gold might nuance how you apply it slightly, but the core logic holds. That's fascinating, seeing how these precise, almost algorithmic M1 techniques echo those century-old market principles. It shows that understanding market structure and liquidity is timeless, really. The tools evolve, but the underlying dynamics often remain similar. Okay, so let's recap the key steps for everyone listening. It's a sequence, a logical flow. Right. Step one, multi-time frame analysis. Use H4, H1 to find your directional bias, bullish or bearish, and identify key HTF points of interest in discount or premium. Step two, wait for price to reach that HTF POI. Then watch the M1 chart for a potential liquidity sweep that Stop Hunt passed a recent M1 high or low. Step three, look for M1 structure confirmation after the POI interaction and sweep. That means a clear impulsive change of character, CHTH, or break of structure, this is P. Digmas, showing the M1 is aligning with the HTF bias. Step 4. Identify the M1 fair value gap, FEG, created by that confirming CH or bias move. Step 5. Plan entry on a retracement back into that specific M1 FEG. And critically, Step 6. Place your stop loss structurally, just beyond the M1 swing high or low that initiated the confirming move, CHBHE, adding a small buffer. Targets are liquidity zones offering good risk reward. That's the framework. It's designed to filter out a lot of market noise and focus on points where multiple factors align, increasing the probability of the setup working out. It demands patience, waiting for that confluence. Waiting for all the pieces of the puzzle to fit. So a final thought for you, our listener. Think about your current analysis. How could you start layering these ideas? Maybe begin by just identifying the HTF bias and POIs, then perhaps start watching for those M1 sweeps and structural shifts around them. How might this structured thinking change the way you see the charts? Yeah, maybe even explore Wyckoff's original work, too. There's so much depth there that still applies today. It's all about building that robust, logical framework for yourself.
