### Objective
Guarantee accurate identification of market structure, POIs, and liquidity traps with exacting standards.

### Logic
- Structural Mapping: Confirm BoS/CHoCH using clean swing point logic.

## 🚫 TrapAvoidanceModule – Anti-Retail Sentiment and Smart Money Framing

### Objective
Reject traditional retail signals as entries; reinterpret them as liquidity traps.

### Logic
- Horizontal S/R flips, trendline breaks, and pattern formations are treated as inducement.
- Confirm these areas are swept before engaging in the opposite institutional move.
- Structure trades around institutional footprints, not retail reactions.
