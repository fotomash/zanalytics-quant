M1 Fair Value Gap (FVG) Trading Logic
This document outlines a specific trading approach using M1 Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) for entries, emphasizing a sequence of confluences for higher probability setups. The M1 FVG entry is viewed as the culmination of a broader narrative involving multi-timeframe alignment, liquidity events, and M1 structural confirmation, reflecting potential institutional order flow.

1. Core Concept: Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) / Imbalances on M1

Definition: An M1 FVG represents an imbalance or inefficiency in price, left behind by a rapid, impulsive price movement on the one-minute chart.

Significance: The strategy operates on the theory that price will often seek to revisit and at least partially fill this M1 FVG before continuing its intended direction, especially when the FVG forms as part of a larger, validated sequence. This FVG is a trace of the effort (sweep and impulse) and a footprint of potential institutional activity.

2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MTFA) Framework

Objective: To establish the overall market direction and identify significant Higher Timeframe (HTF) areas of interest.

Higher Timeframes (HTF - e.g., H4, H1):

Trend Determination: Analyze the sequence of highs and lows (e.g., higher highs/lows for uptrends, lower highs/lows for downtrends) to determine the prevailing HTF bias. Consider broader macro context, sentiment, and news flows.

Identify HTF Points of Interest (POIs): Locate unmitigated FVGs or Order Blocks (OBs) on these HTFs that align with the established trend. These are key zones where price moved away sharply and hasn't revisited efficiently.

In a bullish HTF trend, look for POIs in "discount" areas (cheaper prices relative to the recent up-move).

In a bearish HTF trend, look for POIs in "premium" areas (more expensive prices relative to the recent down-move).

Lower Timeframes (LTF - e.g., M15, M5):

Monitor Price Reaction: As price approaches an HTF POI, observe on LTFs for initial clues like slowing momentum or subtle structural shifts suggesting the HTF level might hold. This interaction is an alert to pay closer attention; it is not an entry signal itself.

3. M1 Liquidity Concepts (The Catalyst)

Objective: To identify a liquidity event on the M1 chart after HTF POI interaction, which can precede the true directional move. This aligns with the idea of institutions engineering liquidity.

Liquidity Sweep (Stop Hunt):

Definition: Price makes a quick move to trigger stop-loss orders, often dipping below a recent M1 low in an anticipated uptrend or spiking above an M1 high in an anticipated downtrend. This "grabs fuel" or "clears the path" by taking out opposing orders.

Significance: An M1 FVG forming after such a sweep is considered higher probability because the path may be clearer, and the impulsive move creating the FVG is seen as more genuine. The "dirty work" of the sweep is done.

Inducement:

Definition: Price action that is deliberately engineered to entice retail traders into taking positions prematurely or on the wrong side of the market, thereby building liquidity that is then swept.

Common Zones: Previous session highs/lows (e.g., Asian session range), obvious recent M1 swing points, or minor structural points that look like early entries.

4. M1 Market Structure Confirmation (The Signal)

Context: Sought on the M1 timeframe after price has interacted with a validated HTF POI and after an M1 liquidity sweep consistent with the HTF bias.

Change of Character (CHoCH) on M1:

Definition: The first sign the immediate M1 trend might be shifting to align with the HTF bias. It's a signal that the M1 is potentially starting to agree with the HTF direction.

Bullish Scenario: After a bullish HTF POI tap and an M1 sweep below a local M1 low, an M1 CHoCH is confirmed when price impulsively breaks above the most recent M1 lower high.

Bearish Scenario: After a bearish HTF POI tap and an M1 sweep above a local M1 high, an M1 CHoCH is confirmed when price impulsively breaks below the most recent M1 higher low.

Key: The break must be impulsive, showing force and conviction. A weak poke is insufficient.

Break of Structure (BoS) on M1:

Definition: Confirms the continuation of the M1 trend, assuming it's already aligned with the HTF bias after a pullback to the HTF POI.

Example: In an M1 uptrend (already aligned with HTF bullishness after HTF POI interaction), an M1 BoS occurs when price makes another impulsive push, breaking a recent M1 high, confirming trend continuation.

Key: The M1 BoS must be a clear, impulsive, and decisive move, indicating a significant shift or continuation in order flow.

5. M1 FVG Identification and Entry Criteria (The Entry)

FVG Formation Context: The M1 FVG of interest is specifically the one created by the impulsive M1 price move that directly causes the M1 CHoCH or M1 BoS. This FVG is not just any random M1 gap; it's a direct consequence and footprint of the confirmed structural shift that followed the liquidity sweep. It's the imbalance left by that sudden, forceful move.

Entry Trigger:

The primary entry is on the retracement of price back into this newly formed, contextually significant M1 FVG.

Entry can be considered as price touches the edge of the FVG. Some traders might wait for a partial fill (e.g., 50%) of the FVG, depending on their risk appetite and the specific setup's characteristics.

High-Probability M1 FVG Entry Sequence (Example for a Long Trade):

HTF Bias Established: H4 timeframe is bullish (e.g., clear uptrend, higher highs and lows).

HTF POI Interaction: Price pulls back and mitigates a significant HTF Demand POI (e.g., an H4 FVG or Order Block in a discount zone of the bullish leg).

M1 Liquidity Sweep: On the M1 chart, price sweeps liquidity below a recent M1 swing low (e.g., Asian session low or other obvious M1 low), often moving into or reacting from the HTF POI.

M1 Change of Character (CHoCH): Price then impulsively breaks above the last M1 swing high (the one that formed before the sweep or during the sweep's lowest point), confirming the M1 CHoCH.

M1 FVG Formation: The impulsive move causing the M1 CHoCH creates a clear M1 FVG. This FVG is the direct result of the institutional footprint.

Entry: Enter a long position when price retraces back into this specific M1 FVG.

6. Stop-Loss (SL) Placement (Risk Management)

Structural Placement: The SL is tied directly to the M1 structure that validated the entry. It's not an arbitrary number of pips but based on a logical invalidation point.

Bullish Entry: Place the SL a few pips below the M1 swing low that initiated the impulsive move causing the M1 CHoCH/BoS and forming the FVG. This is the origin of the impulse.

Bearish Entry: Place the SL a few pips above the M1 swing high that initiated the impulsive move causing the M1 CHoCH/BoS and forming the FVG.

Rationale (Invalidation): If this M1 initiating swing point is breached, the immediate M1 market structure that justified the trade entry is considered broken, and the trade premise is invalidated. The reason for entry no longer holds.

Volatility Consideration (e.g., Gold): For volatile instruments like Gold, allow a slightly wider buffer for the SL (a few extra pips beyond the structural point) to avoid being prematurely triggered by wicks or spread noise. However, the placement must still be structurally sound. Avoid placing the SL too tightly within the M1 FVG itself, as it can be easily wicked. The SL should protect the swing point that created the FVG.

7. Profit Target (TP) Setting (Reward Management)

Initial TP (Scalping / Short-Term Management):

Target the next opposing M1 or M5 liquidity pool. For a buy entry, this would be the nearest recent M1 or M5 swing high. For a sell entry, the nearest M1 or M5 swing low. This acts as a logical first area where price might react.

Secondary TP (Intraday Objective):

Target a more significant LTF structural point (e.g., M15 swing high/low) or an unmitigated FVG on a slightly higher timeframe like M15 or H1 that aligns with the trade direction.

Ultimate TP (Aligned with HTF Bias):

If the M1 entry is strongly aligned with the established HTF directional bias and originated from a significant HTF POI, the ultimate target can be the original HTF objective (e.g., a distant H4 swing high/low, the other side of the HTF range, or another major HTF POI).

Risk-to-Reward (R:R) Ratio: Always assess the R:R ratio before entry. Aim for a favorable R:R, ideally 1:2 or higher, even for the initial TP. If the first logical target doesn't offer a good R:R, the trade might be skipped.

Partial Profits: Consider taking partial profits at closer, more probable targets (like the Initial TP). This secures gains, reduces risk on the remaining position (allowing a move of SL to break-even or better), and allows a portion of the trade to potentially run for larger targets.

8. Confluence Factors (Optional Enhancements for Higher Probability)

Fibonacci Retracement:

Draw the Fibonacci tool on the M1 impulse leg that created both the M1 FVG and the M1 CHoCH/BoS.

Confluence is added if the M1 FVG aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 61.8%, or the Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) zone, typically between 70.5% and 79%).

Volume Analysis:

Ideally, see strong, above-average volume accompanying the M1 impulse leg that creates the FVG and breaks structure (CHoCH/BoS). This shows conviction.

Observe lower, diminishing volume during the retracement of price back towards the M1 FVG. This suggests a lack of interest in the pullback and that the impulse direction is more dominant.

Session Dynamics:

Favor setups that occur during high-volatility trading sessions (e.g., London, New York "Kill Zones").

Be aware of common session-based patterns, such as London Open sweeps of Asian session highs/lows (a "Judas Swing") that drive price into an HTF POI, potentially setting up the M1 liquidity sweep and subsequent FVG entry. This adds a time-based element to liquidity targeting.

9. Important Considerations

Probabilistic Nature: FVGs are probabilistic, not guaranteed. The M1 FVG is the result of the sequence, not the starting point of analysis. Not all FVGs will hold or fill.

M1 Timeframe Noise: The M1 chart is inherently noisy. Strict adherence to the full sequence (HTF context, HTF POI interaction, M1 sweep, M1 structure confirmation before looking for the FVG) is crucial to filter out unreliable setups. Do not skip steps.

Discipline and Risk Management: Non-negotiable. The sequence must be followed rigorously. Predefine risk per trade and use appropriate position sizing.

Universal Principles: The underlying principles of multi-timeframe analysis, structure, and liquidity apply across different forex pairs and other assets, though specific parameters like SL placement may need adjustment for volatility.

This framework emphasizes that the M1 FVG entry is the culmination of a series of observed market behaviors, aiming to align with potential institutional order flow by identifying a precise entry point after a confirmed sequence of events.
