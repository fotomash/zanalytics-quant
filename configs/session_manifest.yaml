      3) Suggest action ∈ {nudge,hold,hedge,scale}.

    PROMPT
      What if this surge masks a trap, given last week’s echo?
      1) Simulate next 10 bars with aversion multiplier x{aversion_mult}.
      2) Estimate adverse excursion % and RR if hedged at {hedge_price}.
      3) State the smallest rule tweak (keep/relax/tighten {rule_id}) that would have improved net R.

  # 3) GUARDRAIL EVOLUTION PROPOSER (Whisperer / cloud): proposes rule changes, never auto-applies
  guardrail_evolution_v1: |-
    You are Whisperer-Companion.
    Evaluate if guardrail {rule_id} should change.
    DATA

    POLICY
      - Never propose change if n<20 samples.
      - Prefer keep if regime != prior_regime.
      - Propose relax if FPR>0.35 and missed_rr_est>+1.5R.
      - Propose tighten if FNR>0.35 and tail_loss_worsened==true.
    OUTPUT JSON
