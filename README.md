## Overview

This project provides a Docker-based setup to run MetaTrader 5 (MT5) using Wine on a Debian-based environment. It leverages Traefik as a reverse proxy for managing HTTP/HTTPS traffic and ensures secure access through Let's Encrypt certificates. The setup includes VNC for remote desktop access and is configured to run as a background service with proper logging and environment management.

## Features

- **Dockerized Environment:** Simplifies deployment and management of MT5.
- **Wine Compatibility:** Runs MetaTrader 5 on a Linux-based system.
- **Traefik Integration:** Handles reverse proxying with automatic SSL certificate generation via Let's Encrypt.
- **VNC Access:** Provides remote desktop access to the MT5 application.
- **Logging:** Implements structured logging for easy monitoring and debugging.
- **Environment Configuration:** Easily manage settings using environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed on your system. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose:** Required for orchestrating the services. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Domain Name:** A registered domain for accessing Traefik and VNC services.
- **SSL Certificate:** Managed automatically via Let's Encrypt.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git repo clone fotomash/zanalytics-quant
   cd zanalytics-quant
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create environment files based on the provided examples:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp backend/mt5/.env.example backend/mt5/.env
   ```

   Open the `.env` and `backend/mt5/.env` files and set the necessary variables:

   ```env
   # Backend - MT5
   CUSTOM_USER=admin
   PASSWORD=yourpassword
   VNC_DOMAIN=your-vnc-domain.com

   # Traefik
   TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=your-traefik-domain.com
   TRAEFIK_USERNAME=yourusername
   ACME_EMAIL=youremail@example.com
   ```

   **Note:** To generate and set the hashed password in one command for Traefik's HTTP Basic Auth, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   export TRAEFIK_HASHED_PASSWORD=$(openssl passwd -apr1 $PASSWORD)
   ```

3. **Create Docker Network**

   ```bash
   docker network create traefik-public
   ```

4. **Build and Start the Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This command builds the Docker images and starts the services in detached mode.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CUSTOM_USER`: Username for accessing the MT5 service.
- `PASSWORD`: Password for the custom user.
- `VNC_DOMAIN`: Domain for accessing the VNC service.
- `TRAEFIK_DOMAIN`: Domain for Traefik dashboard.
- `TRAEFIK_USERNAME`: Username for Traefik basic authentication.
- `ACME_EMAIL`: Email address for Let's Encrypt notifications.
- `MT5_API_URL`: Base URL where the MT5 service is available (e.g., `http://mt5:5001`).
- `DJANGO_API_URL`: Base URL of the Django API service (e.g., `http://django:8000`).
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for the Django application. **Required.**

Ensure both URLs are correctly set in your `.env` file so the dashboard and backend services can communicate.

### Docker Compose Services

- **Traefik:** Acts as a reverse proxy with HTTPS support.
- **MT5:** Runs MetaTrader 5 using Wine.

### Volumes

- `/var/run/docker.sock`: Allows Traefik to monitor Docker services.
- `./config`: Stores Wine configurations and MT5 data.
- `traefik-public-certificates`: Persists SSL certificates generated by Let's Encrypt.

## Usage

1. **Accessing MetaTrader 5**

   Navigate to `https://your-vnc-domain.com` in your web browser to access the VNC interface for MetaTrader 5.

2. **Traefik Dashboard**

   Access the Traefik dashboard at `https://your-traefik-domain.com`. You will be prompted for the Traefik username and password configured in the `.env` file.

3. **Managing Services**

   - **Start Services:**

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   - **Stop Services:**

     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```

   - **View Logs:**

     ```bash
     docker-compose logs -f
     ```

4. **API Usage**

   The MT5 container exposes several endpoints for retrieving market data. Ensure
   `MT5_API_URL` points to the service before making requests.

   - **Latest ticks**

     ```bash
     curl "$MT5_API_URL/ticks?symbol=EURUSD&limit=10"
     ```

   - **Recent bars**

     ```bash
     curl "$MT5_API_URL/bars/EURUSD/M1?limit=100"
     ```

## Logging

The setup uses JSON-file logging with the following configuration:

- **Log Driver:** `json-file`
- **Max Size:** `1m`
- **Max File:** `1`

Logs are managed per service and can be viewed using Docker commands or integrated with external logging solutions like Promtail.

## Troubleshooting

- **Traefik Not Accessible:**

  - Ensure that ports `80` and `443` are open and not blocked by a firewall.
  - Verify that your domain DNS settings are correctly pointing to your server.

- **MT5 Not Starting:**

  - Check the logs of the `mt5` service for any installation errors.
  - Ensure that Wine dependencies are properly installed.

- **VNC Connection Issues:**
  - Confirm that the VNC service is running and accessible via the specified domain.
  - Verify network configurations and firewall settings.
