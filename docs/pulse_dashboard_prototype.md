# Pulse Dashboard Prototype

A lightweight Streamlit interface for behavioral and risk analytics.

### Quick start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run dashboard/pulse_dashboard.py
```

The app reads configuration from `pulse_dashboard_config.yaml` and mock trade data from `trade_history.json`.
