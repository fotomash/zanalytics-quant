# 2025-09 Requirements Audit

A requirements audit is scheduled for September 2025. To preserve the current state of the project before audit preparations begin, a snapshot tag has been created.

- **Snapshot tag:** `snapshot-pre-audit`

This tag marks the repository state prior to the audit. Contributors should reference this tag when comparing changes leading up to the audit period.
