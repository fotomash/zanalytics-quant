# ZANFLOW v17 Prompt Engineering System Documentation

Generated: 2025-06-06T04:38:14.999560

## Overview

This comprehensive system provides a structured approach to generating high-quality prompts for trading strategy implementation using Claude Opus 4. The system is organized into three main components:

### 1. Highest Quality Prompts (`zanflow_prompt_engineering_system.json`)

Contains master and specialized prompt templates optimized for:
- **Master Trading Strategy Prompt**: Comprehensive framework for any trading scenario
- **SMC Structural Flip Specialist**: Focused on Smart Money Concept reversals
- **Wyckoff Phase Analyst**: Integration of classical Wyckoff with modern order flow
- **Session Liquidity Hunter**: Session-based liquidity grab strategies

Each prompt includes:
- Detailed parameter specifications
- Step-by-step analysis requirements
- Decision logic frameworks
- Output format specifications

### 2. YAML Logical Blocks (`zanflow_logical_blocks.yaml`)

Modular components that can be combined to create custom strategies:
- **Context Analysis Block**: Market state and bias determination
- **Structure Detection Block**: BOS/CHoCH identification and validation
- **POI Identification Block**: Order blocks, FVGs, and breaker detection
- **Entry Trigger Block**: Precision entry timing and confirmation
- **Risk Management Block**: Adaptive stop loss and target calculation
- **Trade Management Block**: Position lifecycle management
- **Scoring Validation Block**: Confluence and predictive scoring

Each block specifies:
- Input requirements
- Processing steps and modules
- Output schemas
- Parameter configurations

### 3. JSON Structural Flow (`zanflow_structural_flow.json`)

Defines the execution sequence and data flow:
- **Phase-based execution**: From initialization to trade closure
- **Data flow mappings**: How information moves between blocks
- **Error handling**: Timeout and fallback strategies
- **Performance optimization**: Caching and parallel execution

## Usage Instructions

### For Strategy Development:
1. Select appropriate prompt template from the system
2. Customize parameters based on your specific requirements
3. Chain logical blocks to create your strategy flow
4. Use structural flow as execution blueprint

### For Live Trading:
1. Initialize with context analysis
2. Monitor for setup conditions using structure detection
3. Validate POIs and await entry triggers
4. Execute with proper risk management
5. Manage position through lifecycle

### For Backtesting:
1. Use prompts to generate historical analysis
2. Apply logical blocks to historical data
3. Follow structural flow for consistency
4. Collect performance metrics at each phase

## Integration with ZANFLOW v17

This system is designed to work seamlessly with your existing ZANFLOW infrastructure:
- Compatible with all uploaded strategy files
- Integrates with existing Python modules
- Supports multi-agent architecture
- Enables persistent memory through structured data

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with context**: Never skip Phase 1 initialization
2. **Validate at each step**: Use checkpoints to ensure quality
3. **Monitor confidence scores**: Only trade high-confidence setups
4. **Maintain state**: Use structured data for persistence
5. **Log everything**: Enable comprehensive journaling

## Customization Guide

To adapt for your specific needs:
1. Modify prompt parameters in the JSON templates
2. Add/remove logical blocks in the YAML configuration
3. Adjust flow sequences in the structural JSON
4. Create specialized prompts for unique strategies
5. Extend error handling for specific scenarios
