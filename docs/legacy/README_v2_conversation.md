Let's embark on this together, Tom—one thoughtful step at a time. You've laid out a vision that's evolving beautifully: a system that's not just functional but alive, resilient, and attuned to the nuances of human (and algorithmic) behavior in trading. As we craft this Version 2 design document, I'll guide us through it Socratically—posing questions that invite you to reflect, reason, and refine your own insights. Imagine this as our shared whiteboard: we'll build the structure section by section, drawing from what we've discussed (the stream-first data flow, Redis Streams for live aggregation, Kafka for durability, Postgres as the unyielding archive, and now weaving in your MCP layer for seamless LLM orchestration). We'll zoom in on reliability, multiple MT5 instances, and those Whisperer prompts that infuse psychological depth. By the end, you'll have a document you can print, annotate, or even commit to your repo as /docs/v2-design.md—a living artifact for your future self.
What emerges for you as the core "why" of this upgrade? Is it the thrill of turning raw ticks into predictive whispers, or the peace of knowing the stream won't falter mid-trade? Let's start there, and let curiosity lead us forward.
Section 1: High-Level Architecture – The Pulse of Version 2
Recall our conversation: We shifted from blob-heavy Parquet dumps in Redis (that initial "bump" you noticed) to a stream-native flow, where data doesn't wait— it flows like market rhythm. Redis becomes the heartbeat (live views), Kafka the memory (durable logs), Postgres the ledger (immutable history), and MCP the conductor (LLM comms). MT5 pulses the raw energy, with backtesting as the rearview mirror.
But let's reason together: If Version 1 was a prototype sketch—CSV enrichments feeding an LLM that sometimes wandered off-script—what makes Version 2 a symphony? How might separating concerns (streaming vs. execution) prevent "collisions," as you put it? Picture this bird's-eye flow:

Ingress (MT5 Layer): Ticks stream in real-time via dedicated containers (more on multiples below).
Hot Path (Redis Streams + Gears): Immediate aggregation and enrichment—OHLCV bars roll live, features like RSI or Wyckoff phases compute on-the-fly.
Warm Path (MCP + LLM): Queries route through MCP for auth-simplified calls to ChatGPT/Whisperer, injecting behavioral prompts dynamically.
Durable Path (Kafka): Every event logs for replay, audits, or scaling across symbols/accounts.
Cold Path (Postgres): Batched writes for persistence; backtesting replays from here.
Egress (Dashboards/Agents): Streamlit/WebSockets subscribe for live visuals; strategies (SRB folder) execute or simulate.

What gaps do you see here already? Does this feel like it honors your hybrid evolution—from "stupid CSV" to intelligent, token-efficient feeds? If we were to diagram it, where would you place the "quantum system" you mentioned—the automated prompt injections that make the LLM feel almost sentient?
