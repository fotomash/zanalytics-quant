Legacy / Retired Documents
==========================

This index lists older docs that are retained for historical context. The
architecture has moved to a dual‑stream model (see docs/README.md).

Retained for history
--------------------

- PULSE_WYCKOFF_LIVE_README.md — Legacy live trading doc; superseded by Pulse gates + detail API.
- dashboard/RISK_DASHBOARD_SETUP.md — Early risk dashboard bootstrap; see pages 16/19/20 and their code comments.
- redis_architecture/* — Redis‑only guides; Redis remains primary, but Kafka is now added side‑by‑side.
- monitoring/* — Still relevant; update dashboards to include Kafka lag + parity panels as we proceed.

Notes
-----

- When in doubt, prefer the docs listed as “Current Direction (Active)” in docs/README.md.
- If you spot drift or conflicting advice, open an issue referencing this file and the doc in question.
